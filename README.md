# CAINode  
A lighweight Unofficial Character.AI API in Node/Deno/Bun JS, It does not require a puppeteer to interact with c.ai because the interaction is conducted with websocket and HTTPS Request (fetch).<br><br>
CAINode is now using ESM. Please read at [Getting Started](#getting-started) first before using CAINode.<br><br>
